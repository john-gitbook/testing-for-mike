# These pages will be moved

These pages will be moved to a new section. Before they can be moved, we must:

1. ~~Delete~~ [broken-reference](broken-reference/ "mention")~~.~~
2. ~~Set up a redirect from~~ [broken-reference](broken-reference/ "mention") ~~to~~ [this-page-will-have-a-page-redirected-to-it.md](this-page-will-have-a-page-redirected-to-it.md "mention")~~.~~
3. Test the redirect, which isn't working. Checking with GitBook about that. No luck so far. Curious if this change made in GH will get synced. It did, and I now see a sync from GitHub in the GitHub sync history. Tried adding some more redirects, but no sync in the history for that, so I'm adding this text to force another sync.&#x20;
